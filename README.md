# React Portfolio

## Description
This is my portfolio, there isn't too much in it yet, but I'm going to try to put all my future projects in it. It currently comes with a short about me, a couple of my projects from the past few weeks, a way to contact me that needs to be set up properly, and a resume consisting of the proficiences that I have from the course. If you need to download that resume, it includes a download button on the same page, all you need to do is click the gray resume. The design for the website is pretty basic, but I will try to make it a little more prettier, even though I am not a front-end developer.
